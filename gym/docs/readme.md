# Table of Contents

 - [Agents](agents.md) contains a listing of agents compatible with gym environments. Agents facilitate the running of an algorithm against an environment.

 - [Environments](environments.md) lists more environments to run your algorithms against. These do not come prepackaged with the gym. 
 
 - [Wrappers](wrappers.md) list of general purpose wrappers for environments. These can perform pre/postprocessing on the data that is exchanged between the agent and the environment.

 - [Miscellaneous](misc.md) is a collection of other value-add tools and utilities. These could be anything from a small convenience lib to a collection of video tutorials or a new language binding.
